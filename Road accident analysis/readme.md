### Road Accident Dashboard

This repository contains the implementation for a Road Accident Dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022. The dashboard provides insights into road accidents, including key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total accidents, casualties by vehicle type, and monthly trends. It is built using Power BI and leverages various functionalities for data processing, modeling, and visualization.

### Steps in Project

1. **Requirement Gathering:** Gathered requirements from stakeholders to understand the desired features and metrics for the dashboard.
2. **Stakeholders in Project:** Identified key stakeholders involved in road safety and transportation to ensure their needs are addressed.
3. **Raw Data Overview:** Reviewed the raw data sources containing information about road accidents for the specified years.
4. **Connecting Data with Power BI:** Established connections to the data sources and imported the necessary datasets into Power BI.
5. **Data Cleaning:** Performed data cleaning and transformation using Power Query to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
6. **Data Processing:** Processed the cleaned data to create additional calculated columns and measures for analysis.
7. **Data Modelling:** Established relationships between multiple tables to support complex queries and visualizations.
8. **Background Design in PowerPoint:** Designed the background layout and aesthetics of the dashboard in PowerPoint for a visually appealing presentation.
9. **Data Visualization/Charts Design:** Created various charts and visualizations to represent the key insights and metrics effectively.
10. **Report/Dashboard Building:** Constructed the dashboard layout and integrated the visualizations to convey meaningful insights.
11. **Insights:** Generated insights from the data analysis to provide actionable recommendations for road safety improvements.

The dashboard fulfills the following requirements outlined by the client:

- Primary KPI: Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and Year-over-Year (YoY) growth.
- Primary KPI's: Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth.
- Secondary KPI's: Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for Current Year.
- Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year.
- Casualties by Road Type for Current year.
- Current Year Casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night.
- Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location.

### Stakeholders

The stakeholders involved in the project include:

- Ministry of Transport
- Road Transport Department
- Police Force
- Emergency Services Department
- Road Safety Corps
- Transport Operators
- Traffic Management Agencies
- Public
- Media

### Conclusion

The Road Accident Dashboard provides comprehensive insights into road accidents, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and take proactive measures to enhance road safety and transportation management. It serves as a valuable tool for monitoring trends, identifying risk factors, and implementing targeted interventions to reduce accidents and casualties on the road.
