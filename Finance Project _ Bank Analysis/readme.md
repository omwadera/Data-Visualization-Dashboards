### Dashboard 1: Summary

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
- **Total Loan Applications:** Calculates the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Monitors Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and tracks changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
- **Total Funded Amount:** Understands the total amount of funds disbursed as loans. Monitors Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Funded Amount and analyses Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
- **Total Amount Received:** Tracks the total amount received from borrowers to assess the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. Analyses Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observes Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
- **Average Interest Rate:** Calculates the average interest rate across all loans. Monitors Month-to-Date (MTD) average interest rate and tracks Month-over-Month (MoM) variations.
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Evaluates the average DTI for borrowers to gauge their financial health. Computes the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and tracks Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.

#### Good Loan v Bad Loan KPIâ€™s
- **Good Loan:** 
  - Good Loan Application Percentage
  - Good Loan Applications
  - Good Loan Funded Amount
  - Good Loan Total Received Amount
- **Bad Loan:**
  - Bad Loan Application Percentage
  - Bad Loan Applications
  - Bad Loan Funded Amount
  - Bad Loan Total Received Amount

#### Loan Status Grid View
- Provides insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI).'
